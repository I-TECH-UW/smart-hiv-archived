For these oral PrEP users, a further test after the baseline screening and every 6–12 months thereafter can be considered. \n\nWhen creatinine screening is conducted, any individuals with an estimated creatinine clearance of ≥60 mL/min can safely be prescribed TDF-containing oral PrEP. Waiting for creatinine screening results should not delay starting oral PrEP, since the results can be reviewed at a follow-up visit. Abnormal creatinine clearance of &lt;60 mL/min should be repeated on a separate day before stopping TDF-containing oral PrEP. Other HIV prevention options should be discussed with the client.</p><blockquote><p><b>documentation</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>condition</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></div>"
